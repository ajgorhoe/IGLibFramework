  <h1 id="about">About the library</h1>
  <p>
    <i>IOptLib</i> (the <i>Investigative Optimization Library</i>)
    is an optimization library for developing and testing algorithms for
    solving engineering optimization problems. A priority goal is to
    develop algorithms suited to problems with computationally expensive
    and possibly noisy evaluation of the response (i.e. objective and
    constraint) functions. The library is intended to provide modular
    building blocks for constructing such algorithms, standardized
    templates for interfacing tools obtained form other libraries, and
    testing environment where different performance aspects of
    algorithms can be readily extensively tested during and after the
    development stage. Currently most of the efforts are devoted to
    algorithms based on successive solution of approximated problems
    obtained by local sampling and approximation of the response
    functions. Such algorithms have complex designs and involve solution
    of many sub-problems such as non-linear or quadratic programming
    problems, matrix algebra, optimal sampling strategies, etc. The
    intention is therefore to gradually accumulate efficient routines
    for solving these problems, which will lead to broader
    serviceability of the library. Any attempt was made to keep open the
    possibility of starting development of new algorithms or attaching
    to the existent functionality at any level. The basic library is
    therefore intended to be distributed as free open source under
    certain conditions. A couple of algorithms will be available under
    different negotiable terms since this is necessary to provide the
    funding for library development, however their building blocks
    together with a set of quite useful algorithms will be provided with
    the basic set that is more open what concerns availability.
  </p>
  <p>
    The original motivation for the library was obtained in
    optimization of forming processes where evaluation of objective and
    constraint functions typically involves complex numerical simulation
    with hundreds of thousands of degrees of freedom, very non-linear
    and path dependent materials, multi-physics and multi-scale
    phenomena etc. As result, not only the calculation of the objective
    and constraint functions takes very long times even on the fastest
    computers or parallel architectures, but these functions often
    contain substantial amount of numerical noise. These conditions
    impose a substantial turn in how algorithm performance is viewed. On
    one hand the most important measure of algorithm efficiency becomes
    the number of function evaluations it takes for calculating optimum
    up to a given accuracy. The CPU time spent by the algorithm becomes
    somehow less important because function evaluations will normally
    require incomparably more computational time. Because running
    optimization procedures will often be just on the limit of
    affordable, the goal will not always be to find an optimal solution
    up to a specified accuracy, but rather to achieve significant
    improvement within affordable computational time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The targeted scope of the library is beyond the area of its
    original motivation. It is intended to provide a pool of algorithms
    for different problems and facilities for extending this pool.
    Beside that, interaction with other libraries and use of the library
    in existing or future software is accounted for as much as possible.
    A lot of stress is put on defining standard data types and function
    prototypes used for different purposes, such as evaluation of
    response functions and their derivatives or for storing results of
    such evaluation and their use in building approximations. These
    standards are defined in such a way that routines for similar tasks
    from other libraries can be easily incorporated in the system, and
    functions that are consistent with library standards can be easily
    exported in standard forms required in other software environments.
    Wrapping functions and data converters are provided for some common
    cases, and the way how one can create own tools for this is being
    documented in manuals. The standards are designed in such a way that
    they are suitable for any environment, in particular to allow
    recursive calls and work in multi-threaded environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The library comes with a set of basic utilities that are
    extensively used in implementation of basic building blocks and
    algorithms. This includes e.g. basic matrix and vector operations
    and generic implementation of data containers such as stacks. These
    utilities are well documented in source code while overview is given
    in <a href="#doc">documentation</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; Many of elementary utilities make use of other free
    libraries. Contribution of people who designed these libraries and
    made them available is gratefully acknowledged.
  </p>

  <h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp; The library has been released experimentally June 2008. It
    was initially planned that the library would be incorporated in
    the optimization software <a href="../../Inverse/index.html">
    <i>Inverse</i></a> as its base
    library. However, this development did not continue after 2007,
    but the software still uses numerous routines from the library.
    The library was released publicly in order to promote the exchange
    of ideas between researchers working on similar problems in
    optimization. Since 2007, the development has migrated completely
    to a more general purpose <a href="../iglib/index.html">IGLib.NET</a>
    framework library, which is actively developed and is based mainly
    on the .NET platform. A large portion of optimization algorithms
    and utilities has been transferred to that platform (some of it
    still in the sandbox section), or it is planned to be transferred.

    <a href="doc/optlib.pdf">IOptLib User's Manual</a>. This manual is mainly 
    intended for users of the library and its developers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="../doc/rep/optalgsimplex.pdf">Simplex algorithms for nonlinear
    constraint optimization problems</a>. This document contains description 
    of a set of modified Nelder-Mead simplex algorithms that can be used for
    constraint nonlinear optimization. These algorithms can be used for solving
    engineering optimization problems when gradients of the objective and constraint 
    functions are not available or these functions are not smooth. The
    described algorithms are implemented in <i>IOptLib</i>.

  <h2 id="examples">Example: Optimization by
    Using Successive Approximations of Response</h2>
  <img alt="" src="s_optapprox_converg.gif" style="width: 398px; height: 396px;">
  <p>
    This figure represents convergence of&nbsp; an algorithm
    based on successive approximation of the response functions.
    Contours of actual objective and constraint function are shown in
    pale colors while contours of&nbsp; approximated functions are
    plotted in stronger colors. Zero constraint contours (actual and
    approximated) are plotted with thicker lines. Small points are the
    sampling points where the response functions (loaded with some level
    of noise) were calculated, and larger points are the solutions of
    the approximated problems.

  <p>
    The figures above shows approximations of the objective (green
    contours) and constraint functions (blue contours, brown 0 contour)
    after 1, 3, 6 and 10 iterations of an algorithm based on successive
    approximations. First, the approximations are very rough, with
    better approximation around the initial point. Over iterations,
    center of the approximated region moves towards optimum (see Figure
    above) and approximation gets better around the optimum while region
    far from optimum is not of interest and is not well approximated.
