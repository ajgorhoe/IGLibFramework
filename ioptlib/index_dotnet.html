    &nbsp; IOptlib.NET is a .NET implementation of its predecessor, the
    <a href="index_c_redir.html"> IOptLib</a> library that has been
    developed in ANSI C. It is based on the IGLib.NET and is mainly
    developed in C#.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; Ioptlib (a shortcut for Investigative Optimization Library)
    is an open optimization library designed to sustain development and
    testing of algorithms for solving practical optimization problems. A
    priority goal is to develop algorithms suited to problems with
    computationally expensive and possibly noisy evaluation of the
    response (i.e. objective and constraint) functions. The library is
    intended to provide modular building blocks for constructing such
    algorithms, standardized templates for interfacing tools obtained
    form other libraries, and testing environment where different
    performance aspects of algorithms can be readily extensively tested
    during and after the development stage. Currently most of the
    efforts are devoted to algorithms based on successive solution of
    approximated problems obtained by local sampling and approximation
    of the response functions. Such algorithms have complex designs and
    involve solution of many sub-problems such as non-linear or
    quadratic programming problems, matrix algebra, optimal sampling
    strategies, etc. The intention is therefore to gradually accumulate
    efficient routines for solving these problems, which will lead to
    broader serviceability of the library. Any attempt was made to keep
    open the possibility of starting development of new algorithms or
    attaching to the existent functionality at any level. It is planned
    that the core library will be distributed as free open source
    library in the future. A couple of algorithms will be available
    under different negotiable terms since this is necessary to provide
    the funding for library development, however their building blocks
    together with a set of quite useful algorithms will be provided with
    the basic set that is more open what concerns availability.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; The original motivation for the library was obtained in
    optimization of forming processes where evaluation of objective and
    constraint functions typically involves complex numerical simulation
    with hundreds of thousands of degrees of freedom, very non-linear
    and path dependent materials, multi-physics and multi-scale
    phenomena etc. As result, not only the calculation of the objective
    and constraint functions takes very long times even on the fastest
    computers or parallel architectures, but these functions often
    contain substantial amount of numerical noise. These conditions
    impose a substantial turn in how algorithm performance is viewed. On
    one hand the most important measure of algorithm efficiency becomes
    the number of function evaluations it takes for calculating optimum
    up to a given accuracy. The CPU time spent by the algorithm becomes
    somehow less important because function evaluations will normally
    require incomparably more computational time. Because running
    optimization procedures will often be just on the limit of
    affordable, the goal will not always be to find an optimal solution
    up to a specified accuracy, but rather to achieve significant
    improvement within affordable computational time. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; The targeted scope of the library is beyond the area of its
    original motivation. It is intended to provide a pool of algorithms
    for different problems and facilities for extending this pool.
    Beside that, interaction with other libraries and use of the library
    in existing or future software is accounted for as much as possible.
    A lot of stress is put on defining standard data types and function
    prototypes used for different purposes, such as evaluation of
    response functions and their derivatives or for storing results of
    such evaluation and their use in building approximations. These
    standards are defined in such a way that routines for similar tasks
    from other libraries can be easily incorporated in the system, and
    functions that are consistent with library standards can be easily
    exported in standard forms required in other software environments.
    Wrapping functions and data converters are provided for some common
    cases, and the way how one can create own tools for this is being
    documented in manuals. The standards are designed in such a way that
    they are suitable for any environment, in particular to allow
    recursive calls and work in multi-threaded environment. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; The library comes with a set of basic utilities that are
    extensively used in implementation of basic building blocks and
    algorithms. This includes e.g. basic matrix and vector operations
    and generic implementation of data containers such as stacks. These
    utilities are well documented in source code while overview is given
    in <a href="#doc">documentation</a>.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; Many of elementary utilities make use of other free
    libraries. Contribution of people who designed these libraries and
    made them available is gratefully acknowledged.<br>

          style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Availability<br>
        </span></small></h2>
    <p><br>
      &nbsp; Currently the library is only available for personal
      projects of its developer. Because there is no funding to support
      library development, the developer is not able to maintain any
      releases on a wider scale. This may change as the library is
      further developed. For now, deals can be made for use of the
      library in individual projects. <br>

    &nbsp; This figure represents convergence of&nbsp; an algorithm
    based on successive approximation of the response functions.
    Contours of actual objective and constraint function are shown in
    pale colors while contours of&nbsp; approximated functions are
    plotted in stronger colors. Zero constrsint contours (actual and
    approximated) are plotted with thicker lines. Small points are the
    samplig points where the response functions (loaded with some level
    of noise) were calculated, and larger points are the solutions of
    the approximated problems.<br>

    &nbsp; The figure above shows approximations of the objective (green
    contours) and constraint functions (blue contours, brown 0 contour)
    after 1, 3, 6 and 10 iterations of an algorithm based on successive
    approximations. First, the approximations are very rough, with
    better approximation around the initial point. Over iterations,
    center of the approximated region moves towards optimum (see Figure
    above) and approximation gets better around the optimum while region
    far from optimum is not of interest and is not well approximated.<br>
