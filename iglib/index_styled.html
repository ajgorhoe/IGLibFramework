  <h1 id="about">About the Library</h1>
  <p>
    IGLib (the Investigative Generic Library) is a utility library for
      efficient development of cross-platform technical and other
      applications. It is developed for the 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET
        framework</a> and its alternatives, such as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_%28software%29">Mono</a>
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET">.NET</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The library has been designed
      and developed
      by <a href="../igor.html"><i>Igor Grešovnik</i></a>. It contains various general 
      utilities such as those for parsing of strings, auxiliary utilities for
      building GUI, a numerical library, I/O utilities  2D and 3D graphics modules,
      parallel computing module,  command-line and fully object-oriented
      interpreters, application framework, etc. It aims at
      providing a well designed base library for development of
      complex numerical and other technical applications. Parts of the
      library have also been used in other areas such as a system for
      managing a histological laboratory or large scale invoicing
      support system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically, the initial motivation for development of the library arose 
    from the need to have a versatile base library for development of complex 
    optimization software. One of the goals 
    was to take utilities and standards from the <a href="../ioptlib/index.html">
    <i>IOptLib</i></a> C library and transfer them to an expressively object object
    oriented C# library, in order to elaborate, extend and implement
    ideas about how an environment for efficient development of
    industrial scale optimization software can be established.
    However, the library has been developed in a much broader scope in mind
    since the beginning of its development.
  </p>
  <p>
    The library depends on several external libraries, of which
    majority are open source (see the <i><b><a
          href="https://www2.arnes.si/%7Eljc3m2/igor/software/codedoc/generated/iglib/ReadMe_IGLib.html">Readme</a></b></i>
    file for more details). It is structured in hierarchic layers that
    are arranged according to the dependence on different types of
    libraries with respect to permissiveness of their licenses and
    according to cross-platform transferability. The extensive base
    layer is allowed to depend only on free open source libraries whose
    licenses does not impose any restrictions neither on commercial nor
    on research use of the libraries or distribution of the derived
    products. The <i>IGLib</i> itself
    has not yet been publicly released under free license. Prior to
    doing so, its author would like to establish stable enough
    development conditions with enough interested parties to enable
    sustainable development. However, the author welcomes initiatives
    for development partnership based on technical or research projects,
    especially those with ambitious and exciting goals.
  </p>

  <h2 id="system_requirements">System Requirements</h2>
  <p>
    <i>IGLib</i> is developed in C# and it targets the 64 bit <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net">.NET</a>
    framework and its
    alternative implementations such as <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>. It is intended as
    higher level utility library for development of cross-platform
    applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, the target platforms are <b>.NET Framework 4.0</b> and <b>4.8</b>, 
    and <b>.NET 8</b>, which are commonly available across the main computing platforms (e.g. in form
    of the open source <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>
    implementation for .NET Framework, and natively by the open source .NET). The source code of 
    substantial portions of code can be compiled for lower versions of the framework, however
    the official recommendation is to stick with .NET 4.8 when the <i>.NET Framework</i> is required.
  </p>



  <!-- TODO: Below - verify that info is up-to-date! -->
  <p>
    It is straight forward to port the library to any modern
    computing platform. The only requirement is that a compatible .NET framework
    is installed on the computer. You may need to download and install 
    either the legacy <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework">.NET
    framework</a> (for Widows operating systems) or 
    <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> (cross-platform)
    or the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download">modern .NET</a> before using the library.
  </p>
  <p>
    It might not be completely straight forward to install the
    framework on <i>older operating systems</i>. For example, on
    Windows XP, you will need to install the Service pack 3 before
    installing the .NET 4 or later. We have not checked whether the
    service pack is also required when using the Mono framework instead
    of .NET.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some specialized portions of the library that are
    difficult to use on some older operating systems. This is true e.g.
    on 32 bit Windows XP for the 3D graphics modules that are based on
    the <a href="https://www.kitware.com/opensource/avdownload.php">ActiViz</a>,
    C# wrappers for the <a href="https://www.vtk.org">VTK library</a>
    (used e.g. in <a href="../software/NeurApp/index.html">NeurApp</a>,
    <a href="../software/AnnApp/index.html"> AnnApp</a>, 
    <a href="../software/IGLibShellApp/index.html">IGShell</a>, and some
    other applications). In these applications, all functionality that
    does not use the problematic libraries should still work correctly.
    For example, with some applications for ANN modelling, one can do
    everything except showing 3D plots of 2-parametric studies. When
    launching such a plot, an error message is launched, but one can
    continue to use the application for other tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of VTK-based 3D plots, the problem is because 64
    bit native libraries are linked with the code, and these can not be
    loaded on a 32 bit system. Due to just in time compiler (JIT), this
    is not an issue with managed libraries, but linking with native
    libraries is different. In order to use 3D modules on 32 bit Windows
    XP, one must use the code that is specifically compiled for 32 bit
    windows. Such code would also work on all 64 bit windows systems,
    but it would the applications would be limited to use up to 2 GB
    RAM. Therefore, downloadable applications are usually prepared for
    64 bit windows. If you would like to use full functionality of such
    applications on 32 bit Windows, check the web site if there is also
    a 32 bit version.
  </p>

  <h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>
  <p>
    The complete library source code is currently available only upon
    special agreement with the author. Author's interest is that the
    library is used and/or developed under a limited number of partner
    agreements until it reaches a sufficient maturity level. It is possible
    that the library is released under a free open source license at a later time.
    For up-to-date information, see the 
    <a href="https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.base.iglib/blob/master/README.md">
      README file</a> 
    of the <a href="https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.base.iglib">IGLib 
    base repository</a>.  
  </p>
  <p>
    A number of applications base on the IGLib have been
    developed by the author of the library or under partner agreement.
    Library binaries are currently available with a simple application
    that very briefly demonstrates a possible use of the library for
    developing an interpreter-based application. You can 
    <a href="../software/IGLibShellApp/index.html">check it out
    here</a> and <a href="../software/IGLibShellApp/download/IGLibShellApp.zip">download</a>
    the demo. The demo contains a Visual Studio project for building
    the application. It is basically just a framework of a
    command-line interpreter based application whose architecture
    follows the simple application framework rules that are used for
    some development projects, student projects, small research
    projects and alike.
  </p>
  <p>The <i>IGLib</i> binaries are currently available as part
    of several <a href="../software/index.html">applications</a>,
    some of which are available on the internet and can be downloaded
    together with the library dll-s. Some of these applications are
    listed below.
  </p>

  <h3 id="app_igshell">IGShell - A command-line shell application based on IGLib</h3>
  <p>
    This is a simple shell application created to demonstrate the
    use of the IGLib libraries in the shell applications. A Visual
    Studio (or MonoDevelop) project is attached that demonstrates how a
    simple shell application is created according to the IGLib
    Standards.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project also includes two hosted applications, the 
    <b><i><a href="../software/IGLibShellApp/HashForm.html#hashform">HashForm</a></i></b> and 
    <b><i><a href="../software/IGLibShellApp/HashForm.html#hashshell">HashShell</a></i></b>. 
    <i>HashForm</i> is a convenience UI application for calculation and verification 
    of hash values, and can be used for file verification. <i>HashShell</i>
    includes utilities for performing common cryptographic tasks such as
    calculation and verification of cryptographic hash functions,
    symmetric encryption and decryption, asymmetric encryption,
    generation and manipulation of keys, digital signatures, and others.

  <h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
  <p>Some examples are included in <i>IGShell</i> downloads. More examples may be added in the future.</p>

  <h1 id="archive">Archive</h1>
  <p>Archive of documentation and downloads for older version of
    IGLib and related software is maintained <a
      href="https://www2.arnes.si/%7Efgreso/archive/software/codedoc/generated/archive.html">here</a>.
    In this way, you can find and download older versions of software in
    order to investigate and resolve compatibility issues, or use
    discontinued features. This is a central location for searching for
    older versions, but some software pages may maintain their own
    archives of older versions, such as <a href="../software/IGLibShellApp/index.html#archive"><i>IGShell</i></a>,
    for example (which also includes distributions of <a
      href="../software/IGLibShellApp/HashForm.html#hashform"><i>HashForm</i></a>
    and <a href="../software/IGLibShellApp/HashForm.html#hashshell"><i>HashShell</i></a>).
