    <h1>IGLib with IGShell - a Simple Shell Application<br>
    </h1>
    This directory contains binaries of the <i>Investigative Generic
      Library</i> (<i>IGLib</i>) and a C# project for the MS Visual
    Studio Express in which a simple shell application is implemented
    based on the library. <br>
    <br>
    You can unpack the compressed directory anywhere on your disk and
    use it.<br>
    <br>
    The application's binary (<i></i><i>IGLibShellFerdo.exe</i>) is
    already in the root directory together with the libraries and can be
    readily run from this location. This is a console application
    controlled by a built-in command-line interpreter, therefore you
    must run it with command arguments that launch specific actions. A
    small number of examples are listed in the command file (a file with
    the <i>.cmd</i> extension) within the root directory.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; For example, you can launch a particular demonstration 2D
    graphic plot by running the following command:<br>
    <br>
    IGLibShellFerdo.exe Shell Internal IG.Script.ScriptGraphics2dBase
    Graph CurvePlotLissajous 5 4<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; This example is listed in a command file so commans-line
    arguments can be just copied to the console where the application is
    run. Here "<i>IGLibShellFerdo.exe</i>" is the name of the
    application's compiled program, "<i>Shell</i>" is the command and
    the rest are arguments to this command. In the particular case,
    actually, "<i>Shell</i>" is the command that launches another nested
    command-line interpreter, "<i>Internal</i>" is the command of that
    nested interpreter that launches internal built-in scripts, "<i>IG.Script.ScriptGraphics2dBase</i>"
    is a full name of such an internal script, "<i>Graph</i>" is a
    command built in this internal script, "<i>CurvePlotLissajous </i>"
    is argument of this command that specifies which type of
    demonstration graph is launched, and 5 and 4 are two parameters of
    this graph that define the final appearance of the plotted curve.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; The <i>IGLib</i> depends on a number of third party
    libraries. Please read the <a href="ReadMe_IGLib.html">IGLib's
      ReadMe file</a> included in the root directory for information
    about these libraries and the IGLib itself. <br>
    <br>
    More information about IGLib and the libraries on which it depends
    can be found on the library's home page:<br>
